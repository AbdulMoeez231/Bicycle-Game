Bicycle Animation
This project showcases a simple animation of a bicycle riding across a scrolling background. The animation is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Prerequisites
To run the animation, you need a web browser that supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Getting Started
To get started with the animation, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the source code files.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Description
The code consists of an HTML file (index.html) that defines the structure of the webpage and includes the necessary CSS and JavaScript code. The CSS code is defined in the <style> tag within the HTML file, while the JavaScript code is placed in the <script> tag at the bottom of the HTML file.

The animation features a bicycle moving across a scrolling background, with rocks and a boy riding the bicycle. The animation can be triggered by clicking the "Boost" button or pressing any key on the keyboard.

HTML Structure
The HTML structure of the webpage is as follows:

The <div class="main"> element represents the main container for the animation.
Inside the main container, the <div class="container"> element holds the animation elements.
The animation is divided into several slides, each represented by a <div class="slides"> element.
The background images of the slides are displayed using the <img> element.
The rocks are positioned using <div class="rock"> elements, and their images are displayed using the nested <img> elements.
The boy riding the bicycle is represented by the <div class="boy"> element, which has a background image of the boy.
The "Boost" button is represented by the <button class="bost"> element.
CSS Styling
The CSS code defines the styles for various elements in the animation. Some notable styles include:

The overall styling for the animation container and slides, including the grid layout and animation properties.
The positioning and appearance of the rocks using the .rock, .rock2, and .rock3 classes.
The styling and animation of the boy riding the bicycle, including the wheel rotation animation.
The styling of the "Boost" button and its animation.
JavaScript Interaction
The JavaScript code handles the interaction and animation triggers. It contains the following functionality:

Selecting the boy element using document.querySelector('.boy') and the "Boost" button element using document.querySelector('.bost').
Adding an event listener to the "Boost" button that toggles the boost class on the boy element, triggering the boost animation.
Adding an event listener to the window object for the keyup event, which toggles the fly class on the boy element, triggering the fly animation.
Modifying the Animation
To modify the animation, you can make changes to the following:

Background images: Replace the image URLs in the <img> elements within the <div class="slides"> elements to use different background images.
Styling: Modify the CSS code within the <style> tag to change the appearance, positioning, or animations of various elements.
Animation triggers: Adjust the JavaScript code within the <script> tag to change the animation triggers or add additional functionality.
